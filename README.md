This is an instruction on how to run my project on the localhost. (Note: the misspelling is by my friend in the group project who worked on backend)

How to run backend Server:

1. Open terminal and change directory (cd) to "frontend" folder and run "npm install" to add all the required dependencies and do the same with "backend" folder

2. Then, when the current directory is "backend" run "node index.js" to start backend server on port 5000 which is on "http://localhost:5000/"

3. Start LiveServer in VSCode

4. Ctrl + c to stop the backend server

How to use the website:
    Firstly sign up to create new account to save data or use "guest" to not save any. And then you will see the calendar with to-do list on the right. The calendar is simple to use, you can click on the day to add or remove tasks and that is it!
